Rapid Application Development library for redCOMPONENT extensions

The main aim of redRAD is to provide a mature and abstracted layer for development that will act as a base model for any future redCOMPONENT extension beeing developed.

There is no convention over configuration in redRAD, unlike its counterparts, because we need more complex structures and hierachy and to solve more complex problems in redRAD.

redRAD is a quicker and more uniform way of creating extensions while adding some very interesting libraries and features to Joomla.

redRAD is not a rapid application development tool based on conventions to automatically create output.

It is our hope that redRAD will be interesting for other Joomla developers or even the Joomla Core.
